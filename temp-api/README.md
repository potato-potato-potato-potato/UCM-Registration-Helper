# temp-api

# Purpose
This folder provides the functions specified in SCRUM-77.
In order to ease the transplantation of these functions into React, there are no dependencies other than node-fetch, which will just be replaced with browser fetch in React.
This folder is only temporary, since once the logic here is moved to React, it will be deleted.
